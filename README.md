# A simple Web application and smart contract allowing users to Swap between a TestToken and Eth on The Goreli Network. 


ðŸš€ The app is a quick one page NextJS application which allows users to login using a injected web3 wallet like metamask and swap tokens between ETH and The NightTestToken. It Uses the uniswap Smart contract driectly. When i was initially writing it i planned on using the uniswap SDK however i ran into trouble with their swap router and their fractions library. Since this was a times assesment i opted to interact with the smart contract directly. This project also supports automatic network switching and some basic level of transaction monitoring.

### Technologies 

- Next.js.
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS.
- Ethers.js
- WAGMI.js (although frankly in retrospect i should have just used redux)
- Redux / ReduxToolkit'
- Hardhat
- OpenZepplin Smart contracts
- Uniswap V3 SDK (Non Functional)


### Requirements

- Node.js 14+ and npm Recomend Node V16.17.0 

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
npm i
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                       # README file
â”œâ”€â”€ __mocks__                       # Mocks for testing
â”œâ”€â”€ .github                         # GitHub folder
â”œâ”€â”€ .husky                          # Husky configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode                         # VSCode configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ public                          # Public assets folder
â”œâ”€â”€ src

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages                       # Next JS Pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages.test                  # Next JS Pages tests (this avoids tests to be treated as a Next.js pages)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles                      # Styles folder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ templates                   # Default template
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils                       # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js              # Tailwind CSS configuration
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json                   # TypeScript configuration
```



### Commit Message Format

The project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
npm run commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```shell
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build-prod
```

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.

### Testing

All tests are colocated with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. Unfortunately, it is not possible with the `pages` folder which is used by Next.js for routing. So, what is why we have a `pages.test` folder to write tests from files located in `pages` folder.
